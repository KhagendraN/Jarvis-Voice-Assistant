## üé§ Real-Time Voice Model Switching

You can change the assistant's voice in real time by saying:
- "Change voice"
- "Switch voice"
- "Use a different voice"
- "Try a different voice model"

Jarvis will cycle through all available voice models and announce the change:

```
User: "Can you change your voice?"
Jarvis: "Voice changed to Samantha."
```

**Available voices:**
- **Nepali_voice**: Nepali language support
- **Samantha**: Professional female voice
- **Jarvis**: Classic assistant voice
- **male_Voice**: Male voice option
- **female_voice**: Female voice option
- **kristin_voice**: Kristin personality
- **normal_female**: Natural female voice
- **AI_type**: Futuristic AI voice

You can add/remove voices by placing `.onnx` and `.onnx.json` files in the `voice_models/` directory.

```

---

## ‚ö° Quickstart

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis-voice-assistant.git
cd jarvis-voice-assistant
```

### 2. **Run Automated Setup**

- Download and install Piper TTS (required for speech synthesis)
- Download Vosk speech recognition model
- Create Python virtual environment
- Install Python dependencies
- Copy configuration templates

### 3. **Download Voice Models**
```bash
bash voice_models/voice_setup.sh
# or
python voice_models/voice_setup.py
```

### 4. **Configure Your Setup**
- **API Keys**: Edit `config.py` with your API keys (Mistral, Weather, News, etc.)
- **Contacts**: Edit `contact.json` with your email contacts
- **Face Image**: Place your photo as `static/known_image.jpeg` for authentication

### 5. **Activate and Run**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstall Script

A new `uninstall.sh` script is included for easy removal of Jarvis and its dependencies. Key points:

- **One-Command Uninstall**: Run `bash uninstall.sh` to remove all installed files, virtual environments, and dependencies added by Jarvis.
- **Removes Voice Models**: Deletes all downloaded voice models from the `voice_models/` directory.
- **Cleans Virtual Environment**: Removes the Python virtual environment created during setup.
- **Deletes Config Files**: Optionally removes configuration files (`config.py`, `contact.json`, etc.) after confirmation.
- **System Cleanup**: Uninstalls system packages (if installed by Jarvis) such as Piper, Vosk models, and other binaries.
- **Safe Operation**: Prompts for confirmation before deleting important files or directories.
- **Log Output**: Provides detailed output of all actions performed for transparency.
- **Cross-Platform**: Designed for compatibility with major Linux distributions.

**Usage Example:**
```bash
bash uninstall.sh
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the uninstallation process.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Error Handling

### Common Issues
- **Missing or Invalid Config**: If you see a message about missing or invalid config values, check your `config.py` and ensure all API keys and file paths are set and valid. The assistant will not start if required config is missing.
- **Missing Scripts or Files**: If a script (e.g., music player, wallpaper selector) is missing or not executable, you will receive a clear error message. Ensure all scripts in the `scripts/` directory are present and have execute permissions.
- **Face Authentication Fails**: If face authentication fails, sensitive operations (shutdown, update, backup, etc.) will be denied. Ensure your face image is present and clear at `static/known_image.jpeg`.
- **Sudo Password Required**: For operations requiring `sudo` (e.g., system update), passwordless sudo is required. If not configured, the operation will be denied and an error will be logged.
- **Dependency Issues**: All dependencies are now unified between `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`. If you encounter missing packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Test Failures**: Tests are now run with `pytest` and include mocks for hardware and network dependencies. See the `tests/` directory for details.

### Logging
- All errors, warnings, and important events are now logged using Python's `logging` module. Check your console output for detailed logs.

### Config Validation
- The assistant validates your config at startup. If any required key or file is missing, you will see a clear error and the program will exit.

---

## üÜï Notable Changes
- **Intent Phrases**: All intent phrases are now stored in `intents.json` for easier maintenance and extension.
- **Structured Logging**: All modules use structured logging for errors and important events.
- **Unified Dependency Management**: `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` are now consistent.
- **Security**: All sensitive operations require successful face authentication and passwordless sudo where needed.
- **User Experience**: All user input is now via voice or consistent UI; no more blocking `input()` calls.
- **Testing**: Tests use `pytest` and mock hardware/network dependencies for reliability.
